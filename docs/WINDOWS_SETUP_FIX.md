# Windows Setup Fix - SSL Certificate Download

## Issue

The original `npm install` was failing on Windows because the `postinstall` script was trying to execute a bash script (`setup-ssl.sh`) which requires WSL or bash to be available.

## Solution

Created a PowerShell equivalent (`setup-ssl.ps1`) and updated the `package.json` to use a cross-platform solution that detects the operating system and runs the appropriate script.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created PowerShell Script

- **File**: `scripts/setup-ssl.ps1`
- **Purpose**: Downloads AWS RDS CA certificate for SSL connections
- **Features**:
  - Creates `src/config/ssl` directory
  - Downloads `rds-ca-2019-root.pem` from AWS S3
  - Validates the downloaded certificate
  - Provides colored output with status messages

### 2. Updated package.json

- **Changed**: `setup:ssl` script to be cross-platform
- **Old**: `"setup:ssl": "bash scripts/setup-ssl.sh"`
- **New**: Cross-platform Node.js script that detects Windows vs Unix and runs appropriate script

### 3. SSL Certificate Status

- âœ… Certificate downloaded successfully: `src/config/ssl/rds-ca-2019-root.pem`
- âœ… File size: 1,456 bytes
- âœ… Certificate is valid for AWS RDS SSL connections

## Security Vulnerabilities

There are 6 moderate severity vulnerabilities detected in transitive dependencies:

- Related to `validator` package used by `express-validator` and `swagger-jsdoc`
- These are not critical for development but should be monitored
- Consider updating dependencies or finding alternative packages for production

## Next Steps

1. âœ… npm install now works on Windows
2. âœ… SSL certificates are properly downloaded
3. ðŸ”¶ Monitor security vulnerabilities and update dependencies as needed
4. âœ… Development environment is ready for local testing

## Commands to Verify Setup

```powershell
# Verify SSL certificate exists
Test-Path "src\config\ssl\rds-ca-2019-root.pem"

# Check certificate file size
(Get-Item "src\config\ssl\rds-ca-2019-root.pem").Length

# Run SSL setup manually if needed
npm run setup:ssl
```
